                      <dl>
                        <dt>Why do people use search engines?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>Without sophisticated search engines, it would be virtually impossible to locate anything on the Web without knowing a specific URL.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Why does Three-Initial Corporation (T.I.C.) offer a search engine on its site?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>It is our objective to interactively restore inexpensive infrastructures as well as continue to quickly synergize timely information. The citizen can rely on Three-Initial Corporation (T.I.C.) IT to to enthusiastically fashion e-services opportunities as well as professionally customize diverse content, so we can quickly initiate innovative solutions to stay relevant in tomorrow's world.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>What do we mean by <em>search engine</em>?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>When people use the term search engine in relation to the Web, they are usually referring to the actual search forms that searches through databases of HTML documents, initially gathered by a robot.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Are all search engines the same? </dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>There are basically three types of search engines: Those that are powered by robots (called crawlers; ants or spiders) and those that are powered by human submissions; and those that are a hybrid of the two.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>What are crawler-based search engines?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>Crawler-based search engines are those that use automated software agents (called crawlers) that visit a Web site, read the information on the actual site, read the site's meta tags and also follow the links that the site connects to performing indexing on all linked Web sites as well. The crawler returns all that information back to a central depository, where the data is indexed. The crawler will periodically return to the sites to check for any information that has changed. The frequency with which this happens is determined by the administrators of the search engine.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>What are human-powered search engines?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>Human-powered search engines rely on humans to submit information that is subsequently indexed and catalogued. Only information that is submitted is put into the index.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>What am I actually searching when I search? Why do I sometimes get dead links?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>In both cases, when you query a search engine to locate information, you're actually searching through the index that the search engine has created —you are not actually searching the Web. These indices are giant databases of information that is collected and stored and subsequently searched. This explains why sometimes a search on a commercial search engine, such as Yahoo! or Google, will return results that are, in fact, dead links. Since the search results are based on the index, if the index hasn't been updated since a Web page became invalid the search engine treats the page as still an active link even though it no longer is. It will remain that way until the index is updated.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Why does The Google get different results from The Bing?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>So why will the same search on different search engines produce different results? Part of the answer to that question is because not all indices are going to be exactly the same. It depends on what the spiders find or what the humans submitted. But more important, not every search engine uses the same algorithm to search through the indices. The algorithm is what the search engines use to determine the relevance of the information in the index to what the user is searching for.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>What is the search actually looking for?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>One of the elements that a search engine algorithm scans for is the frequency and location of keywords on a Web page. Those with higher frequency are typically considered more relevant. But search engine technology is becoming sophisticated in its attempt to discourage what is known as keyword stuffing, or spamdexing.</p>
                          <p>Another common element that algorithms analyze is the way that pages link to other pages in the Web. By analyzing how pages link to each other, an engine can both determine what a page is about (if the keywords of the linked pages are similar to the keywords on the original page) and whether that page is considered &quot;important&quot; and deserving of a boost in ranking. Just as the technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated to ignore keyword stuffing, it is also becoming more savvy to Web masters who build artificial links into their sites in order to build an artificial ranking.</p>

                        <dt>What meaningless historical fact can you put here even though it has nothing to do with what I'm trying to accomplish?</dt>
                        <dd>
                          <p>The first tool for searching the Internet, created in 1990, was called &quot;Archie&quot;. It downloaded directory listings of all files located on public anonymous FTP servers; creating a searchable database of filenames. A year later &quot;Gopher&quot; was created. It indexed plain text documents. &quot;Veronica&quot; and &quot;Jughead&quot; came along to search Gopher's index systems. The first actual Web search engine was developed by Matthew Gray in 1993 and was called &quot;Wandex&quot;.</p>

I have been informed that any search on the Internet may affect the financial resources generally available for me, including my  existing assets, and that this may include dissing the stock market and other investment types in general  terms, including market risks and recent or historic economic events and activities.

                      <h4>The operating system you are using might not be one we have tested</h4>
                      <p>An operating system (called an OS for short) is a set of programs that runs your computer. A computer is made of hardware (your monitor, hard disk, motherboard and so on) and software (for example your word processor, and the web browser you are reading this on right now). The job of the operating system is to tell the hardware how it should operate, and how the software should use the hardware. It also provides the basic user interface - the thing that tells you where your files are, how to open them, close them and so on.</p>
                      <p>You are probably familiar with the Windows operating system, but there are many different types of windows OS, and many other operating systems that are completely different. These are not supported.</p>
                      <p>All the hardware on your computer has a program called a 'driver'. For a piece of hardware to run it needs to have a driver written for the OS of the computer it is plugged into. The driver tells the OS what the hardware is, and how it should be used. Even if the same hardware can be used on several different operating systems, it needs a separate driver for each of them. This means that if you want to change your OS, you need to check carefully that your hardware has drivers for the new OS or the hardware will stop working. Hardware is not supported.</p>
                      <p>If an operating system gets into trouble, it might stop working and your computer will crash. This is not supported. Because a crashed windows OS often leaves its final words in white on a blue background, you may hear of people talking about a BSOD (blue screen of death). The important thing required of a modern OS is that it should be stable (i.e. that it should not crash), that it can multi-task (do several different things at once), be powerful (be able to deal with large hard disks, lots of files, and large amounts of RAM) and that it should be secure (so that hackers and viruses cannot damage it). It should be user-friendly (so that users can do what they want in a simple uncomplicated way). It should not involve something called &quot;Internet Explorer,&quot; and it should never, ever come into contact with something called &quot;SharePoint.&quot;</p>
                      <p>For many years there were three main operating systems. Windows replaced MS-DOS as the main OS on most desktop computers, while a smaller number of radical vegetarian anarchist food hippies were dedicated to their Apple computers and their completely different OS, which is not supported. However, more powerful computers which ran networks used a more complex, flexible and powerful OS called Unix, which is not supported. A new arrival called Linux has since enthused computer enthusiasts. Linux is powerful, stable and secure, though many people complain that it is not yet very user-friendly. The interesting thing about Linux is that it has not been written by one person or company, but by hundreds of programmers all around the world who all contribute as individuals. There are many different flavours of Linux, such as Ubuntu, Fedora and SUSE. Linux is not supported.</p>
                      <p>In the last few years,'live' versions of Linux operating systems have been distributed on bootable CDs. This means that you can put the CD in your computer, and run Linux from there, so that you can see if you like it before you install it on your computer's hard disk. This is not supported.</p>
